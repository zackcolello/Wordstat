The Great Gatsby

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind
ever since.
‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,
‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.’
He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m in

clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim
of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy
to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the con

fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,
preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver

men or at least the terms in which they express them are
usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to
the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded
on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point
I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from
the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in
uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want

gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he
were related to one of those intricate machines that register
earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness
had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’—
it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness
such as I have never found in any other person and which
it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned
out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily
closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-
winded elations of men.

warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like

It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,
more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked helpless

I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I

And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves
growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I

ca. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself
due east of New York and where there are, among other
natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty
miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into
the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western
Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.
They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus

their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a

Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable
East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the
summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to
have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second
cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college. And
just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,

to do that.
Why they came east I don’t know. They had spent a year
in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here
and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were
rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over
the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I
drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarce

ly knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I
expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial man

sion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and
ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping
over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—final
-
ly when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright
vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front
was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with
reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon,
and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his
legs apart on the front porch.
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he
was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard
mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant
eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him
the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not
even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide
the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those
glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you
could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enor
-
mous leverage—a cruel body.
His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the im
-
pression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of
paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and
there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.
‘Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,’

he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a
man than you are.’ We were in the same Senior Society, and
while we were never intimate I always had the impression
that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with
some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
‘I’ve got a nice place here,’ he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat
hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken
Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-
nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.
‘It belonged to Demaine the oil man.’ He turned me
around again, politely and abruptly. ‘We’ll go inside.’
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-
colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French
windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming
white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a
little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room,
blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,
twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the
ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, mak

ing a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.
The only completely stationary object in the room was an
enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed
up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both
in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if
they had just been blown back in after a short flight around
the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to

Chapter 2
A
bout half way between West Egg and New York the
motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside
it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain
desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic
farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and
grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and
chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcen
-
dent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling
through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars
crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and
comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up
with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which
screens their obscure operations from your sight.
But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust
which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment,
the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J.
Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard
high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of
enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent
nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there
to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then
sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them
and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many
paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the sol

‘I beg your pardon,’ said Mr. McKee with dignity, ‘I didn’t

lor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night,
‘anyways, for an hour!’
When I came opposite her house that morning her white
roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a
lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed
in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet
away.
‘Hello Jordan,’ she called unexpectedly. ‘Please come
here.’
I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because
of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I
was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well,
then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The
officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way
that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and
because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the
incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn’t
lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met
him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.
That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a
few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so
I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly old
-
er crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors
were circulating about her—how her mother had found her
packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say
goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effec
-
tually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her
family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around
with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed,

The Great Gatsby
short-sighted young men in town who couldn’t get into the
army at all.
By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She
had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was
presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June
she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp
and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He
came down with a hundred people in four private cars and
hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before
the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour be
-
fore the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as
lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk
as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a
letter in the other.
’ ‘Gratulate me,’ she muttered. ‘Never had a drink before
but oh, how I do enjoy it.’
‘What’s the matter, Daisy?’
I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that
before.
‘Here, dearis.’ She groped around in a waste-basket she
had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.
‘Take ‘em downstairs and give ‘em back to whoever they
belong to. Tell ‘em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say ‘Daisy’s
change’ her mine!’.’
She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and
found her mother’s maid and we locked the door and got
her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She

took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet
ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw
that it was coming to pieces like snow.
But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of
ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back
into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of
the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident
was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchan

an without so much as a shiver and started off on a three
months’ trip to the South Seas.
I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and
I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband.
If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily
and say ‘Where’s Tom gone?’ and wear the most abstract
-
ed expression until she saw him coming in the door. She
used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour
rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with
unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them togeth

er—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was
in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into
a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front
wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the pa
-
pers too because her arm was broken—she was one of the
chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.
The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to
France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later
in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle
down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They
moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and

wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.
Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not
to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your
tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregulari
-
ty of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they
don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at
all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers....
Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for
the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you re
-
member?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had
gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and
said ‘What Gatsby?’ and when I described him—I was half
asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the
man she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected
this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.
When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had
left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria
through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the
tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and
the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the
grass, rose through the hot twilight:
‘I’m the Sheik of Araby,
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you’re are asleep,
Into your tent I’ ll creep——’
‘It was a strange coincidence,’ I said.
‘But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.’

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave

was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with

and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his
legs apart on the front porch.
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he
was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard
mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant
eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him
the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not
even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide
the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those
glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you
could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enor

he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a
man than you are.’ We were in the same Senior Society, and
while we were never intimate I always had the impression
that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with
some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
‘I’ve got a nice place here,’ he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat
hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken
Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-
nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.
‘It belonged to Demaine the oil man.’ He turned me
around again, politely and abruptly. ‘We’ll go inside.’
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-
colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French
windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming
white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a
little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room,

When I came opposite her house that morning her white
roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a
lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed
in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet
away.
‘Hello Jordan,’ she called unexpectedly. ‘Please come
here.’
I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because
of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I
was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well,
then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The
officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way
that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and
because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the
incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn’t
lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met
him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.
That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a
few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so
I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly old

were circulating about her—how her mother had found her
packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say
goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effec

family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around
with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed,

The Great Gatsby
short-sighted young men in town who couldn’t get into the
army at all.
By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She
had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was
presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June
she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp
and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He
came down with a hundred people in four private cars and
hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before
the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour be
-
fore the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as
lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk
as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a
letter in the other.
’ ‘Gratulate me,’ she muttered. ‘Never had a drink before
but oh, how I do enjoy it.’
‘What’s the matter, Daisy?’
I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that
before.
‘Here, dearis.’ She groped around in a waste-basket she
had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.
‘Take ‘em downstairs and give ‘em back to whoever they
belong to. Tell ‘em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say ‘Daisy’s
change’ her mine!’.’
She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and
found her mother’s maid and we locked the door and got
her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She

took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet
ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw
that it was coming to pieces like snow.
But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of
ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back
into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of
the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident
was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchan

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind
ever since.
‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,
‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.’
He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m in
-
clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim
of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy
to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the con
-
fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,
preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some
unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver

ing on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young
men or at least the terms in which they express them are
usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still

ther snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense
of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at
birth.
And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to
the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded
on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point
I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from
the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in
uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want
-
ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses
into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby
who represented everything for which I have an unaffect
-
ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful
gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he
were related to one of those intricate machines that register
earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness
had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’—
it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness
such as I have never found in any other person and which
it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned
out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily
closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-
winded elations of men.

raways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that
we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the ac

tual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who
came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and
started the wholesale hardware business that my father car

ries on today.
I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look
like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled
painting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New
Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father,
and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic mi
-
gration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid
so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the
warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like
the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and
learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond
business so I supposed it could support one more single
man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were
choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—ye-
es’ with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance
me for a year and after various delays I came east, perma

nently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was
a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns
and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office sug

gested that we take a house together in a commuting town
it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather
beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the
last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went

out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a
few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish
woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut

tered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,
more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked helpless
-
ly.
I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I
was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casu
-
ally conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves
growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I
had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over
again with the summer.
There was so much to read for one thing and so much
fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giv

ing air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and
investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and
gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold
the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Mae
-
cenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many
other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one
year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials
for the ‘Yale News’—and now I was going to bring back all
such things into my life and become again that most limited
of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man.’ This isn’t just an
epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a
single window, after all.

It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a
house in one of the strangest communities in North Ameri
-
ca. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself
due east of New York and where there are, among other
natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty
miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into
the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western
Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.
They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus
story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but
their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a
more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every
particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the
two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bi
-
zarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My
house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the
Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented
for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right
was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imi
-
tation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on
one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a
marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn
and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or rather, as I didn’t
know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentle
-
man of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it
was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a

The Great Gatsby
view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and
the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dol
-
lars a month.
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable
East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the
summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to
have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second
cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college. And
just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,
had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played
football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of
those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at
twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-cli
-
max. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college
his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but
now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather
took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a
string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to real
-
ize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough
to do that.
Why they came east I don’t know. They had spent a year
in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here
and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were
rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over
the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into
Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seek
-
ing a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some
irrecoverable football game.

By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She
had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was
presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June
she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp
and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He
came down with a hundred people in four private cars and
hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before
the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour be

lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk
as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a
letter in the other.

but oh, how I do enjoy it.’
‘What’s the matter, Daisy?’
I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that
before.
‘Here, dearis.’ She groped around in a waste-basket she
had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.
‘Take ‘em downstairs and give ‘em back to whoever they
belong to. Tell ‘em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say ‘Daisy’s
change’ her mine!’.’
She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and
found her mother’s maid and we locked the door and got
her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She

Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for
the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you re
-
member?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had
gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and
said ‘What Gatsby?’ and when I described him—I was half
asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the
man she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected
this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.
When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had
left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria
through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the
tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and
the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the
grass, rose through the hot twilight:
‘I’m the Sheik of Araby,
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you’re are asleep,
Into your tent I’ ll creep——’
‘It was a strange coincidence,’ I said.
‘But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.’

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind
ever since.
‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,
‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.’
He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m in

name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby
who represented everything for which I have an unaffect

ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful
gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he
were related to one of those intricate machines that register
earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness
had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’—
it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness
such as I have never found in any other person and which
it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned
out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily
closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-
winded elations of men.

came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and
started the wholesale hardware business that my father car

I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look
like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled
painting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New
Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father,
and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic mi
-
gration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid
so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the
warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like
the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and
learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond
business so I supposed it could support one more single
man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were
choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—ye-
es’ with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance
me for a year and after various delays I came east, perma

The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was
a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns
and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office sug

it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather
beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the
last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went

out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a
few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish
woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut

tered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,
more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked helpless
-
ly.
I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I
was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casu

ally conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves
growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I
had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over
again with the summer.
There was so much to read for one thing and so much
fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giv

investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and
gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold
the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Mae

cenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many
other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one
year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials
for the ‘Yale News’—and now I was going to bring back all
such things into my life and become again that most limited
of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man.’ This isn’t just an
epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a
single window, after all.

It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a
house in one of the strangest communities in North Ameri
-
ca. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself
due east of New York and where there are, among other
natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty
miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into
the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western
Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.
They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus
story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but
their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a
more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every
particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the
two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bi
-
zarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My
house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the
Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented
for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right
was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imi
-
tation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on
one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a
marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn
and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or rather, as I didn’t
know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentle
-
man of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it
was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a

The Great Gatsby
view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and
the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dol
-
lars a month.
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable
East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the
summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to
have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second
cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college. And
just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,
had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played
football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of
those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at
twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-cli

max. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college
his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but
now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather
took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a
string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to real
-
ize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough
to do that.
Why they came east I don’t know. They had spent a year
in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here
and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were
rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over
the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into
Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seek

ing a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some
irrecoverable football game.

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I
drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarce

ly knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I
expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial man

ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping
over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—final

ly when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright
vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front
was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with
reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon,
and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his
legs apart on the front porch.
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he
was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard
mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant
eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him
the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not
even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide
the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those
glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you
could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder
moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enor
-
mous leverage—a cruel body.
His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the im
-
pression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of
paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and
there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.
‘Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,’

he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a
man than you are.’ We were in the same Senior Society, and
while we were never intimate I always had the impression
that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with
some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
‘I’ve got a nice place here,’ he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat
hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken
Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-
nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.
‘It belonged to Demaine the oil man.’ He turned me
around again, politely and abruptly. ‘We’ll go inside.’
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-
colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French
windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming
white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a
little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room,
blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,
twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the
ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, mak

The only completely stationary object in the room was an
enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed
up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both
in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if
they had just been blown back in after a short flight around
the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to

Chapter 2
A
bout half way between West Egg and New York the
motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside
it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain
desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic
farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and
grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and
chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcen

dent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling
through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars
crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and
comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up
with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which
screens their obscure operations from your sight.
But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust
which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment,
the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J.
Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard
high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of
enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent
nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there
to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then
sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them
and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many
paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the sol

lor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night,
‘anyways, for an hour!’
When I came opposite her house that morning her white
roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a
lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed
in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet
away.
‘Hello Jordan,’ she called unexpectedly. ‘Please come
here.’
I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because
of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I
was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well,
then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The
officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way
that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and
because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the
incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn’t
lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met
him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.

and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his
legs apart on the front porch.
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he
was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard

eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him
the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not

he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a
man than you are.’ We were in the same Senior Society, and
while we were never intimate I always had the impression
that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with
some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
‘I’ve got a nice place here,’ he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat
hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken
Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-
nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.
‘It belonged to Demaine the oil man.’ He turned me
around again, politely and abruptly. ‘We’ll go inside.’
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-
colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French
windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming
white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a
little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room,
blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,
twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the
ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, mak

The only completely stationary object in the room was an

Chapter 2
A
bout half way between West Egg and New York the
motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside
it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain
desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic
farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and
grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and
chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcen

dent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling
through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars
crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and
comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up
with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which
screens their obscure operations from your sight.
But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust
which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment,
the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J.
Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard
high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of
enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent
nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there
to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then
sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them
and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many
paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the sol

lor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night,
‘anyways, for an hour!’
When I came opposite her house that morning her white
roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a
lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed
in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet
away.
‘Hello Jordan,’ she called unexpectedly. ‘Please come
here.’
I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because
of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I
was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well,
then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The
officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way
that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and
because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the
incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn’t
lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met
him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.
That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a
few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so
I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly old
-
er crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors
were circulating about her—how her mother had found her
packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say
goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effec
-
tually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her
family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around
with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed,

The Great Gatsby
short-sighted young men in town who couldn’t get into the
army at all.
By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She
had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was
presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June
she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp
and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He
came down with a hundred people in four private cars and
hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before
the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour be
-
fore the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as
lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk
as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a
letter in the other.
’ ‘Gratulate me,’ she muttered. ‘Never had a drink before
but oh, how I do enjoy it.’
‘What’s the matter, Daisy?’
I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that
before.
‘Here, dearis.’ She groped around in a waste-basket she
had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.
‘Take ‘em downstairs and give ‘em back to whoever they
belong to. Tell ‘em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say ‘Daisy’s
change’ her mine!’.’
She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and
found her mother’s maid and we locked the door and got
her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She

took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet
ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw
that it was coming to pieces like snow.
But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of
ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back
into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of
the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident
was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchan

an without so much as a shiver and started off on a three
months’ trip to the South Seas.
I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and
I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband.
If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily
and say ‘Where’s Tom gone?’ and wear the most abstract
-
ed expression until she saw him coming in the door. She
used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour
rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with
unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them togeth

in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into
a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front
wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the pa
-
pers too because her arm was broken—she was one of the
chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.
The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to
France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later
in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle
down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They
moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and

wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.
Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not
to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your
tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregulari
-
ty of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they
don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at
all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers....
Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for
the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you re
-
member?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had
gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and
said ‘What Gatsby?’ and when I described him—I was half
asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the
man she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected
this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.
When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had
left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria
through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the
tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and
the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the
grass, rose through the hot twilight:
‘I’m the Sheik of Araby,
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you’re are asleep,
Into your tent I’ ll creep——’
‘It was a strange coincidence,’ I said.
‘But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.’

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind
ever since.
‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,
‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages that you’ve had.’
He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m in

clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim
of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy
to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the con

fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,

unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to
the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded
on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point
I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from

‘I’ve got a nice place here,’ he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat
hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken
Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-
nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.
‘It belonged to Demaine the oil man.’ He turned me
around again, politely and abruptly. ‘We’ll go inside.’
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-
colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French
windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming
white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a
little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room,
blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,
twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the
ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, mak

The only completely stationary object in the room was an
enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed

desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic
farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and
grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and
chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcen

dent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling
through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars
crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and
comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up
with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which
screens their obscure operations from your sight.
But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust
which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment,
the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J.
Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard
high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of
enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent
nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there

‘Keep your hands off the lever,’ snapped the elevator
boy.
‘I beg your pardon,’ said Mr. McKee with dignity, ‘I didn’t

‘All right,’ I agreed, ‘I’ll be glad to.’

between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great
portfolio in his hands.
‘Beauty and the Beast ... Loneliness ... Old Grocery

Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the
Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning ‘Tribune’ and
waiting for the four o’clock train.
